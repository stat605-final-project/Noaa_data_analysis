Runing Code in following order:

1. Run getdata.sub by CHTC. Each year (1877-2018) will get three files, eg: 2018_tmax.csv, 2018_tmin.csv, 2018_prcp.csv.
2. Run merge.sh in a folder contains .csv files produced by step 1. Get three files: TMAX.csv, TMIN.csv, PRCP.csv
3. Process the three files produced by step2 in R in self laptop. Run Code1.R, then Code2.R.

Notes:
When we run step 1 using CHTC, it is very strange that some years will generate three empty files(tmax/tmin/prcp).
We run it several times, but the missing years are totally random, and the corresponding .err files are empty and provide no information. 
So we have to fill in value for these years additionally by ourselves.
